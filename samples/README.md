This folder is used to store sample data required for testing.
The samples SHOULD NOT be placed here directly. 
Instead the following hierarchy is preferred:

* samples - root directory
  * blends - directory for .blend Blender samples
  * pmx - directory for PMX model samples
  * pmd - directory for PMD model samples

The samples need to be downloaded and placed in the corresponding directory. 
Each sample will have assigned a maintainer which will be responsible of keeping the download available and update or replace the sample if necessary. If the sample is obtained from an external source and it becomes unavailable the maintainer is responsible of replacing the sample.

The samples are provided as is, for the purpose of testing and may be subject to specific terms and/or usage guidelines.

The rest of this document will list the downloads of the samples.
